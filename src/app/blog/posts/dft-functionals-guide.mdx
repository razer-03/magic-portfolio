## Choosing DFT Functionals

Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the backbone of modern quantum chemistry, but with hundreds of functionals available, choosing the right one can be overwhelming.

## Quick Recommendations

For most quantum chemistry calculations:

- **General purpose**: ωB97X-D or M06-2X
- **Large systems**: B3LYP-D3 or PBE0-D3  
- **Transition metals**: M06 or TPSS
- **Weak interactions**: ωB97X-D or B97-D3

## Understanding Functional Types

**GGA (Generalized Gradient Approximation)**
- Examples: PBE, BP86, BLYP
- Good for: Bulk properties, geometry optimization
- Fast but less accurate for energies

**Hybrid Functionals**
- Examples: B3LYP, PBE0, M06-2X
- Include exact exchange from Hartree-Fock
- Better for energetics and barrier heights

**Range-Separated Hybrids**
- Examples: ωB97X-D, CAM-B3LYP
- Variable exact exchange with distance
- Excellent for charge transfer and excited states

## Dispersion Corrections

Always include dispersion corrections for:
- Weak interactions
- Large molecular systems
- π-π stacking
- Van der Waals complexes

Popular schemes: D3, D4, or built-in corrections.

## Basis Set Considerations

- **Small molecules**: def2-TZVP or 6-311+G(d,p)
- **Large systems**: def2-SVP or 6-31+G(d,p)
- **High accuracy**: def2-QZVP or cc-pVTZ

## Practical Tips

1. **Start simple**: B3LYP-D3/def2-SVP for initial studies
2. **Validate**: Compare with experiment or high-level methods
3. **Be consistent**: Use same functional/basis throughout study
4. **Consider cost**: Balance accuracy with computational resources

## Common Pitfalls

- Using B3LYP without dispersion correction
- Mixing functionals between geometry and energy
- Ignoring basis set superposition error (BSSE)
- Over-relying on default functionals

Remember: The best functional depends on your specific system and properties of interest.
