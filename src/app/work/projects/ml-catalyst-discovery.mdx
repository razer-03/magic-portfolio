## Project Overview

This project combines quantum chemistry with machine learning to predict catalyst activity for sustainable chemistry applications, focusing on CO₂ reduction and nitrogen activation.

## Motivation

Traditional catalyst discovery is slow and expensive. Our approach leverages computational methods to:

- Generate large datasets of catalyst properties
- Train ML models to predict activity
- Screen thousands of candidates rapidly
- Identify promising new catalysts

## Methodology

### Dataset Generation

We use DFT calculations to compute properties for transition metal catalysts:

- Binding energies for substrate molecules
- Activation barriers for key reaction steps  
- Electronic properties and descriptors
- Thermodynamic stability measures

**Computational Protocol:**
- Functional: M06 (optimized for transition metals)
- Basis set: def2-TZVP
- Solvent: Implicit solvation (THF/toluene)
- Dispersion: D3 corrections included

### Machine Learning Pipeline

**Feature Engineering:**
- Electronic descriptors (HOMO-LUMO gaps, charges)
- Geometric descriptors (bond lengths, angles)
- Chemical descriptors (Sterimol parameters, buried volume)

**Model Architecture:**
- Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) for molecular structure
- Gradient boosting for tabular descriptors
- Ensemble methods for improved accuracy

## Results

### Dataset Statistics
- 12,500 catalyst structures across 8 metals
- 4 target properties per catalyst
- 50,000 total calculations performed

### Model Performance
- **Binding Energy**: R² = 0.89, MAE = 2.4 kcal/mol
- **Activation Barrier**: R² = 0.82, MAE = 3.1 kcal/mol
- **Selectivity**: Classification accuracy = 87%

### Discovery Acceleration
- Traditional screening: weeks per catalyst
- ML prediction: seconds per catalyst  
- 100,000× speedup in candidate evaluation

## Key Discoveries

1. **Ligand Design Rules**: Identified optimal electron-donating groups for CO₂ activation
2. **Metal Selection**: Copper-based complexes show unexpected high activity
3. **Geometric Constraints**: Bite angle strongly correlates with selectivity

## Impact

- 3 new catalyst candidates synthesized and tested
- 15% improvement in CO₂ conversion efficiency
- 2 patent applications filed
- Open-source dataset released for community use

## Future Directions

- Expand to other catalytic reactions
- Include solvent effects in ML models
- Develop active learning strategies
- Integrate with experimental high-throughput screening

This work demonstrates how ML can transform catalyst discovery from serendipity to systematic design.
